About Me <br>

I am a mass spectrometrist and metabolism scientist with over eight years of experience in -omics research, specializing in the analysis of small molecules, metabolites, lipids, and proteins. My expertise lies in bottom-up metabolomics and lipidomics, where I design advanced mass spectrometry workflows and develop custom software solutions to streamline data processing. <br>

I work at the intersection of analytical chemistry and computational biology, developing and validating high-resolution LC-MS/MS methods for drug discovery, biomolecule characterization, and affinity selection projects. My approach combines targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry techniques to deliver high-quality insights that support multidisciplinary life science research. <br>

Research and Publications <br>

Much of my work has focused on bacterial metabolism, where I discovered a new futile cycle in E. coli and other bacteria (Ryback et al., 2023). I have also studied adaptations to vitamin biosynthesis loss (Ryback et al., 2022) and designed workflows to investigate mitochondrial function and exercise performance (Sprenger et al., 2025; Langston et al., 2023). <br>

I have developed methods for trace analysis in human plasma to explore chemotherapy-induced neuropathy biomarkers (Knoerl et al., 2024) and examined mechanisms of microbial community interactions (Hemmerle et al., 2022). <br>
