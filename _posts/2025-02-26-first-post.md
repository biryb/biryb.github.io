Optimizing Chromatography for Untargeted Metabolomics: A Data-Driven Approach

In untargeted metabolomics, one of the biggest challenges is selecting the right liquid chromatography (LC) method. Many tutorials still rely on older systems, making them difficult to follow, especially when trying to measure complex compounds rather than the simpler ones often demonstrated. For metabolomics practitioners, compounds like organic acids—lactate, citrate, and pyruvate—are particularly troublesome, as they often cause poor peak shapes. Similarly, central sugar phosphates tend to co-elute, and multiply phosphorylated intermediates like ATP also result in issues with peak integrity. Optimizing chromatography methods is critical for better coverage, resolution, and throughput of your analysis.

The process of chromatography optimization is a multi-dimensional task, involving several factors such as peak shapes, coverage, and peak density along the gradient. When setting up untargeted methods, chromatography needs to be matched to the compound of interest, balancing method length and column properties. Choosing between C18 and HILIC columns is an important decision; C18 columns, which bind hydrophobic compounds, often require organic solvents for elution, while HILIC columns offer a similar effect without adverse side effects. The particle size and column length also impact the resolution, with longer columns providing better separation but increasing method time. Finally, adjusting the column diameter allows for controlling the flow rate, which affects sample dilution and sensitivity. These considerations come together in a data-driven approach to chromatography, leading to more efficient and effective untargeted metabolomics methods.

Conceptual Proposals for Improvements in Chromatography Optimization

To further improve chromatography methods, several conceptual proposals can be explored. Adjusting the flow rate, slope, and isocratic holds are key factors that can significantly impact the separation efficiency and metabolite coverage. By experimenting with combinations of these parameters, it is possible to refine the chromatographic process to achieve optimal results. Tracking the development metrics over approximately 100 runs provides valuable insights into the method's performance, allowing for the identification of any stagnation in the metrics. By monitoring this stagnation, the shortest and most efficient method can be chosen, ensuring a balance between speed and resolution. Additionally, these adjustments can lead to an increase in metabolite coverage, as demonstrated in a few mouse tissues, showing how fine-tuning these variables can enhance the detection of a broader range of metabolites, ultimately improving the depth and accuracy of untargeted metabolomics analysis.
